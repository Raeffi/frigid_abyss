You will also cool faster when wet. You can insulate your armor using certain items such as wool, fur, hoglin hide, etc. If the temperature is above or below the habitable range you will slowly freeze/overheat. You can use hot/cold blocks, a hearth, or food (ice cream cools, tea + soup + cocoa will heat you up) to keep your temperature in check.$(br)"
